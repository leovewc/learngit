Tutorial (Recursion)
Question 1:
Write a recursive function to calculate the factorial of user input number.
int fact (int n)
Question 2:
Write a program to create one dimensional array and do the followings:
(a).	Call a recursive function to print the element in normal order.
  
void print(int arr[],int n,int i)
{ if (i==n)
        return;
     cout<<arr[i]<<" ";
        print(arr,n,i+1);
}
int main()
{   int n=10;
    int arr[]={1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9};
    print(arr,n,0);
    return 0;
}


(b).	Call a recursive function to print the elements in reverse order.
   void print(int arr[],int n,int i)
{ if (i==n)
        return;
     print(arr,n,i+1);
     cout<<arr[i]<<" ";
}
int main()
{   int n=10;
    int arr[]={1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9};
    print(arr,n,0);
    return 0;
}
Question 3:
Write a recursive function to calculate value of n to the power of m (nm).
Question 4:
The Fibonacci sequence is defined as numbers in the following integer sequence:
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21…
Each Fibonacci number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. Mathematically, it can be defined as follows:
F0 = 0, F1 = 1, Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2 where n = 2, 3, 4, …
Write a complete C++ program to calculate Fn, Fibonacci value for a given number n. Your program should:
•	prompt user to enter a number, n.
•	calculate the Fibonacci value, Fn using a direct recursive function.
•	display the calculated Fibonacci value, Fn.


Question 5:

Given a mathematical formula as follows:	
f(n) = 0	if n = 0
f(n) = f(n-1) + 5	if n > 0
(a)	Write a direct recursive function based on the mathematical formulae above using the function prototype below:
int f(int n);
(b)	Implement the above mathematical formulae using a loop.
(c)	Write a complete C++ program to test the direct recursion and the loop that you have written in part (a) and (b). Prompt the user for n values.
